# Intro to Classification

## Questions that Data Science Methods Can Answer

- How Many or How Much of something (Regression)
- **Is this observation A or B, or C or D or E...  (Classification)**
- What groupings exist in the data already (Clustering)
- What should we expect to happen next? (Time Series Analysis)
- Is this weird? (Anomaly Detection)

## What are Classification algorithms?

- Classification is a supervised learning task. That means we train on data w/ answers/labels

- We train with ansers/labels to produce a `decision rule` we'll use to classify future data.

## Big Concepts
- With classification, we use labeled data to train algorithms to make a formal decision

- The decision boundary becomes becomes the decision rule that discerns A from B (or C or D).
